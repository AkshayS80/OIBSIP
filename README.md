This Repository contains the successfully completed tasks as a part of the **Data Science Internship** at **Oasis Infobyte**.

The tasks are as follows:

## Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification

Using the data set, I was able to predict the species from the physical features of the iris flowers(i.e, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
For this Machine Learning Project, I had used the SVM(Support Vector machine) Algorithm as the basis for the modal and used it to classify the flowers.
