This Repository contains the successfully completed tasks as a part of the **Data Science Internship** at **Oasis Infobyte**.

The tasks are as follows:

## Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification

### Algorithm used- Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM)

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.  
Using the data set, I was able to predict the species from the physical features of the iris flowers(i.e, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). 

## Task 2 - Unemployment Analysis with Python

### Algorithm used- NA

Unemployment occurs when someone is willing and able to work but does not have a paid job. Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19,So analysing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.The project includes 2 data sets from which we will compare the rates of unemployment during the years 2019 and 2020. 

Using the two datasets, I was able to do the comparisons through visualizations and basic statistical insight.


## Task 5 - Sales Prediction

### Algorithm used- Linear Regression

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. 

With the dataset, I was able to predict the sales from the amount spent on different advertising mediums(i.e,TV,Radio and Newspaper)
